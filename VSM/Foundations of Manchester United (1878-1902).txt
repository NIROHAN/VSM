Document 1: Foundations of Manchester United (1878-1902)
The origins of Manchester United trace back to 1878 when it was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club. Initially a works team for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, the club struggled financially and faced relegation threats. In 1902, a local brewery owner, John Henry Davies, rescued the club, leading to a rebranding as Manchester United and ushering in a new era of ambition.
